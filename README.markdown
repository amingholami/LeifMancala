LeifMancala
===========

Introduction
------------

This is a variant of the classic Mancala or Kalaha game written in C++ for a school project. It's all text based. Contrary to the classic Mancala game LeifMancala allows for more than 2 players. It seems to work (I havn't really tested it though), but the code is not that good :-(.

How to run and compile
----------------------

The game is run from the main method in LeifMancala.cpp.

The game has been compiled successfully on linux (Ubuntu 11.10) with g++ using a auto generated make file from Eclipse.
